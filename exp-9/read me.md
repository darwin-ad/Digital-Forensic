### Step 2: Explore the Interface 🖱️

Process Explorer displays processes in a hierarchical tree structure. Each process is **color-coded** based on its status:

| Color | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pink** | Suspended processes ⏸️ |
| **Light Blue** | Processes running under your account 👤 |
| **Dark Blue** | System services or processes 🖥️ |
| **Green** | Newly started processes 🟢 |
| **Red** | Recently terminated processes ❌ |

### Step 3: Spotting Suspicious Processes ⚠️

To investigate potentially harmful processes:

1. **Check Unknown Processes:**  
   Look for unfamiliar names. Trusted processes usually come from known vendors like Microsoft, Adobe, or Intel. ✅
2. **Verify Digital Signatures:**  
   Right-click → **Properties** → **Image** tab. Check for a valid **Digital Signature**. Unsigned processes may be risky. 🛑
3. **Examine File Paths:**  
   Check the **Path** under the Image tab. Legitimate system processes are usually in `C:\Windows\System32`. Running from temp or user folders is suspicious. 📁
4. **Monitor Resource Usage:**  
   Watch for processes consuming excessive CPU, memory, or disk resources without explanation. 💻
5. **Review Process Details:**  
   Lack of description or unclear company names can indicate a suspicious process. 🕵️‍♂️
6. **Inspect Network Activity:**  
   Right-click → **Properties** → **TCP/IP** tab. Unexpected external connections require attention. 🌐

### Step 4: Research Suspicious Processes 🔎

* Search the process name online (e.g., `cmd.exe`) to learn more about it. 🌍
